The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state.

Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines.
