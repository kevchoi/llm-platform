Given a question and the relevant context, decide if the question is answerable from the context. Keep the answer concise and don't start with articles unless necessary.

Return exactly valid JSON (and nothing else) with this schema:
{"answerable": true|false, "answer": "<string>"}

If unanswerable, set "answerable" to false and "answer" to "".
